This app is for a simple game of hangman. I coded in a way to enter the secret word, and 
for the public to try to guess it. I still need to add pictures, but the game itself runs smoothly.
The code does require right now that the player only use lowercase letters. Its a simple game, 
you guess a letter, and if it is correct it appears in the space that it goes in the secret word, and if not it takes one of your chances away. 
When all your chances are gone, you lose, and if you complete the word, you win.
